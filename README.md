This counter contains 2 blocks.
The settings block allows you to enter
the minimum and maximum value of the counter
and then insert these values into the counter
block (by condition, the maximum and minimum
values cannot be negative, equal, the maximum
value cannot be less than the minimum, in these
cases the 'set' and 'increment' buttons is disabled).
The 'counter block' allows you to increment the set
values from the 'settings block', when the maximum value
is reached, the 'increment' button is disabled.
